### What is blockchain technology?

Blockchain is the concept of continuously validating and chaining validated data into chunks or blocks.

A single block in a blockchain is validated using hashing.

In the context of crypocurrencies, validating a block involves hashing all transactions within a period, a block, and continously computing a hash that meets some requirements.

Each new block contains a mark from the previous, hence, block-chain.

Validation of blocks takes a lot of time, therefore, a dedicated network of computers take on the job of hashing.

Much like every day internet, a decentralised network is a collection of computer interconnected to one another that usually perform the same task in an attempt to prevent authority from one single entity.

The bigger the network, the more reliable it is considered. 

The idea behind putting a lot of work into a block is to prevent...

### What are hashing algorithms and how do they work?

Hashing algorithms allows any input of data and transformed into a piece of text, a hash, of known length.
> Hashing algorithms are functions that generate a fixed-length result (the hash, or hash value) from a given input. The hash value is a summary of the original data.

A hash of a given input will always return the same output.

Hashing algorithms generate hashes that, by design, cannot be reversed engineer into the hashes original form.

# Hashing Algorithms 

### What are hashing algorithms and how do they work?

Hashing algorithms allows any input of data and transformed into a piece of text, a hash, of known length.
> Hashing algorithms are functions that generate a fixed-length result (the hash, or hash value) from a given input. The hash value is a summary of the original data.

A hash of a given input will always return the same output.

Hashing algorithms generate hashes that, by design, cannot be reversed engineer into the hashes original form.

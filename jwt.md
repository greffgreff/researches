# Json Web Token

### Introduction
The Rently project found [here](https://github.com/rently-io) heavily relies on JWTs to authorize requests that modify data. For instance, in the User service found [here](https://github.com/rently-io/user-service), JWTs are required to verify a user's identity on DELETE request. In the Listing service, JWTs are used to verify the listing's ownership.

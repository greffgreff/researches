# Technical Debt

### Introduction

Code is never perfect. After each new additions to a source code, bugs are remain unattended, hidden within the lines of code. There comes a time when a good software developer needs to spend time looking at his old code to mitigate those issues. “I swear I’ve seen this code a thousand times now.” 
To better maintain his code, he uses tools such as static code analysis to better identify code defects and vulnerabilities. With it comes technical debt that provides some idea as to how much time should a given refactorisation take to complete. Technical debt is also known as code debt or design debt.
This report aims to better grasp code debt and solidify already known concepts in an IT project.
When should technical debt be considered?

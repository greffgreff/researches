# Testing UX

### Overview
Occasionally, software developers must work on creating some form of user interface. Although UI design isn't a core function of a software developers, knowing how to make a usable and effecient design can help a lot in one's workflow. Understanding where works needs to be allocated design wise can lead to smipler and better features.

User experience can be tested in a [number of ways](https://www.hotjar.com/usability-testing/methods/). It can either be remote or in person, monitored or unmonitored, exploratory or assertive. In the context of Rently, we would like to test the application in its current form to identify potential design flaws or uncover whether some features are well implemented design wise. Therefore, we can conduct unmonitored remote assertive testing by simply letting users use the website freely.

In this report, we will conduct research on the useability of the [Rently](https://github.com/rently-io) project. More specifically, we will anwser **To what extend does the design of Rently usable?**

### Test setup
In order to perform remote testing, Hotjar, a tool made for tracking events (user interactions) anonymously, was intergrated into the source code of the website following [these steps](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009336727-How-to-Install-your-Hotjar-Tracking-Code). 

I asked some people to use the website freely. With the exception that they use the desktop version of the website, no prerequisite was asked. A total of 12 people tested the website.

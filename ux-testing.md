# Testing UX

### Overview
Occasionally, software developers must work on creating some form of user interface. Although UI design isn't a core function of a software developers, knowing how to make a usable and effecient design can help a lot in one's workflow. Understanding where work needs to be allocated design wise can lead to simpler and better features.

User experience can be tested in a [number of ways](https://www.hotjar.com/usability-testing/methods/). It can either be remote or in person, monitored or unmonitored, exploratory or assertive. In the context of Rently, we would like to test the application in its current form to identify potential design flaws or find out whether some features are well implemented design wise.

In this report, we will conduct research on the useability of the [Rently](https://github.com/rently-io) project. More specifically, we will anwser **Are there any design flaws on Rently?** To answer this question, unmonitored remote testing was conducted by simply letting users use the website freely.

Hotjar, a tool made for tracking events (mouse clicks and movements) anonymously, was intergrated into the source code of the website following [these steps](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009336727-How-to-Install-your-Hotjar-Tracking-Code). Hotjar  Data can therefore be collected on a per page basis. A lot can be uncovered throught tracking mouse movements. It can reveal where users' interest is highest and where is it the lowest, it can also reveal user frustration or places in the design where users get stuck. It can also reveal things that were never intended by the developer. 

I asked a random selection of people to use the website freely. With the exception that they use the desktop version of the website, no prerequisite was asked. A total of 13 people tested the website, performing vaiours tasks from simply browsing listings to posting one themselves. Data was collected across the web pages.
